% BeampositionQueries -- What they are used for, and what can go wrong.
%
% GNU/Linux, MacOS-X and MS-Windows provide a mechanism that allows to
% query the scanline which is currently updated by the scanning beam of a
% CRT display or by the equivalent mechanism in a video beamer or flat
% panel display, the so called "beamposition".
%
% We use this mechanism for two purposes:
%
% 1. Independent measurement of the monitor refresh interval: Psychtoolbox
% executes a measurement loop during Screen('OpenWindow') where it determines
% the monitor refresh interval. It takes a timestamp whenever the beamposition
% resets to zero at the start of a new display refresh cycle. The difference
% between consecutive timestamps is a sample of refresh duration. The samples
% of 50 consecutive refresh cycles are averaged. The "length" of the VBL
% is also computed as the difference between screen height (e.g., 1024 at a
% display resolution of 1280 x 1024 pixels) and the highest scanline value
% encountered during the 50 refresh cycles.
%
% This measurement is used to cross-check the results of the synchronization tests
% (see 'help SyncTrouble') and the value provided by the operating system to 
% make the sync tests and display calibration as robust as possible, even
% if the operating system reports bogus values like 0 Hz, which can happen
% on MacOS-X and Windows with some flat panels.
%
% 2. Highly accurate and robust stimulus onset timestamps in Screen('Flip').
%
% In normal operation, the Screen('Flip') command, after issuing a buffer-swap
% request to the gfx-hardware, pauses execution until the operating system
% signals swap-completion in sync with vertical retrace. Then it takes a high-
% precision system timestamp. Due to the scheduling jitter present in any
% operating system, sometimes the execution of Psychtoolbox is resumed only after
% some random multi-millisecond delay has passed after buffer-swap, so the
% stimulus onset timestamp can be possibly off by multiple milliseconds from
% the real stimulus onset time. This is unwanted timing noise, especially if
% the time stamp is to be used for either computing stimulus onset time for
% future stimuli, or for synchronizing Psychtoolbox execution with other
% stimulus generators or acquisition hardware.
%
% On Microsoft Windows 2000 and later, Beamposition timestamping is fully
% supported.
%
% On GNU/Linux, timing precision even in non-realtime scheduling mode is
% far superior to all other operating systems, yielding a timing jitter of
% less than 100 microseconds under normal operating conditions. For special
% needs, there exist multiple methods of improving timing down to
% microsecond level, although some of time require some advanced
% programming skills. If Psychtoolbox runs on any recent AMD/ATI, NVidia or
% Intel graphics card, it will utilize beamposition queries for even better
% timing precision. If your Linux system uses an open-source graphics
% driver for NVidia ("nouveau"), AMD/ATI ("radeon") or Intel GPU's, as well
% as on various embedded GPU's (Smartphones and Tablets, embedded systems
% etc.), Linux itself has a built-in high precision timestamping facility
% which is even more robust and precise than Psychtoolbox beamposition
% timestamping.
%
% On MacOS-X, whose timing accuracy is somewhere between Linux and Windows,
% and luckily closer to Linux quality than to Windows timing. We use
% beamposition queries to improve accuracy of our timestamps, either with
% the native support on PowerPC computers and IntelMacs with NVidia
% graphics, or with the help of the PsychtoolboxKernelDriver (see "help
% PsychtoolboxKernelDriver") on cards from AMD/ATI, Intel and optionally
% for NVidia. An alternative mechanism, based on vertical blank interrupts,
% is implemented on OS/X up to 10.6, should the beamposition mechanism
% malfunction or become unavailable. Another backup mechanism is CoreVideo
% timestamping, employed on 10.7 "Lion" and later as a backup solution.
% However this backup solution is not very robust, so we basically always
% recommend installing the PsychtoolboxKernelDriver for best results.
%
% This is how beamposition queries are used:
%
% When taking the system timestamp, we also query the current rasterbeam
% position. From the known height of the display (in scanlines, including
% height of VBL), and the known refresh interval of our display, we can
% translate the current beam position into "elapsed time since start of VBL
% == elapsed time since double buffer swap". By subtracting this elapsed
% time value from our system timestamp, we get a corrected timestamp - the
% real system time of double buffer swap == start of VBL == aka stimulus
% onset. This allows for very accurate timestamps, despite possible
% non-deterministic multi-millisecond timing jitter. Psychtoolbox goes
% through great pains during startup to double-check that all required
% calibration values and mechanisms are accurate and working properly. You
% can assess the accuracy of all returned timestamps by use of the script
% VBLSyncTest. A visual correctness test is provided by
% PerceptualVBLSyncTest. PTB also performs continuous runtime checking to
% detect possible problems caused by defective graphics card drivers.
%
% In case that beamposition queries should not work properly or are not supported,
% PTB will use different fallback strategies:
%
% On Microsoft Windows, only a normal - possibly noisy - timestamp is taken.
%
% On MacOS-X, PTB tries to get low-level access to the kernel interrupt
% handlers for the VBL interrupts for OSX versions prior to 10.7 "Lion", or
% CoreVideo CVDisplayLink timestamps on 10.7 and later and uses its values
% for timestamping the time of buffer- swap. This method is slightly less
% accurate and robust than the bemposition method, but should be still
% suitable for most applications on OSX 10.6 and earlier. The robustness and
% correctness of CVDisplayLink timestamps is not that great on 10.7 and later,
% therefore this fallback mechanism may be removed in a future PTB release.
% If these queries should fail as well, PTB falls back to pure timestamping
% without any correction.
%
% To get best precision and reliability on OSX 10.7 and later we strongly
% recommend you install the PsychtoolboxKernelDriver and use the
% Screen('Preference','ConserverVRAM') setting 2^16
% (kPsychDontUseNativeBeamposQueries -- see "help ConserveVRAMSettings").
%
% On Linux, built-in OpenML timestamping has the highest priority and is
% available on the open-source graphics drivers (intel, radeon, nouveau).
% Should that functionality be missing, beamposition timestamping is used
% on NVidia, AMD/ATI and (optionally) Intel with the proprietary graphics
% drivers, followed by the equivalent of kernel-level vbl timestamping
% should that fail as well for some reason, followed by uncorrected
% timestamping.
%
% The behaviour of PTB can be controlled by the command:
% Screen('Preference', 'VBLTimestampingMode', mode); where mode can be one of the
% following:
%
% -1 = Disable all cleverness, take noisy timestamps. This is the behaviour
%      you'd get from any other psychophysics toolkit, as far as we know.
%  0 = Disable kernel-level/CoreVideo fallback method (OSX and Linux), use
%      either beamposition or noisy stamps if beamposition is unavailable.
%  1 = Use beamposition. Should it fail, switch to use of kernel-level interrupt
%      timestamps. If that fails as well or is unavailable, use noisy stamps.
%  2 = Use beamposition, but cross-check with kernel-level timestamps.
%      Use noisy stamps if beamposition mode fails. This is for the paranoid
%      to check proper functioning.
%  3 = Always use kernel-level timestamping, fall back to noisy stamps if it fails.
%  4 = Use OpenML OML_sync_control extension for high-precision timestamping on
%      supported system configuration. This is currently a Linux only feature on
%      some specific systems.
%
% The default on OS-X and Windows is "1", and "4" on Linux.
%
% If the beamposition query test fails, you will see some warning message about
% "SYNCHRONIZATION TROUBLE" in the Matlab/Octave command window or other
% error messages, as diagnostics is performed at various stages of setup
% and operation.
%
% There are two possible causes for failure:
%
% 1. System overload: Too many other applications are running in parallel to
% Psychtoolbox, introducing severe timing noise into the calibration and test loop.
% See 'help SyncTrouble' on what to do. This happens rather seldomly.
%
% 2. Driver bug: Not much you can do, except submit a bug report to Apple or Microsoft
% for your specific hardware + software setup. This is by far the most
% common cause of failure. Psychtoolbox tries to enable work-arounds for
% some common problems if possible. Usually you should update your graphics
% card driver to see if that resolves the problems.
%
% Note: Apple's Retina MacBook Pro's ship with a broken NVidia graphics
% driver that causes beamposition timestamping to fail. Please install the
% PsychtoolboxKernelDriver on such systems and set the kPsychDontUseNativeBeamposQuery
% flag in Screen('Preference', 'ConserveVRAM', x); ie., x must include the
% value 2^16, e.g., add this to the top of your script:
%
% v = bitor(2^16, Screen('Preference','ConserveVRAM'));
% Screen('Preference','ConserveVRAM', v);
%
% This will cause PTB to use our own implementation of beamosition queries,
% which apparently isn't as shoddy as Apple's work.
%
% Note: As of Spring/Summer 2008, many graphics cards + driver combos from
% ATI and NVidia on WindowsXP have bugs which cause beamposition queries to
% fail in a peculiar way. If PTB detects that failure case, it will enable
% some workaround to keep the mechanism going at slightly reduced accuracy:
% Timestamps will still be mostly jitter-free and consistent, so they are
% fully useable for timestamping, timing checks and as a basis for timed
% stimulus presentation and animation. However, all returned timestamps
% will contain a constant bias wrt. the real stimulus onset time of
% somewhere between 20 microseconds and 1.5 milliseconds, depending on your
% display settings, because Psychtoolbox can't determine the total height
% of your display in scanlines (including the invisible VBL interval)
% anymore. Exact height is important for spot-on timestamps. Psychtoolbox
% uses some safe, conservative value for its internal computations, so
% results will be consistent and useable, but contain a small constant offset.
%
% In some rare cases, PTB's automatic test fails to detect the bug and
% doesn't enable the workaround by itself. You can manually enable the
% workaround if you want by adding the setting 4096
% (kPsychUseBeampositionQueryWorkaround) to the value x passed via:
% Screen('Preference', 'ConserveVRAM', x);
%
% Just insert this command at the top of your scripts before any other
% Screen() commands. 'x' must be at least 4096 or the sum of 4096 and any
% other values you may want to pass with that command. See "help
% ConserveVRAMSettings" for other workarounds that you can enable manually
% if needed.
% 
% If you want to get rid of that small offset, e.g., because you need to
% synchronize with other modalities or stimulation/recording equipment at
% sub-millisecond precisison, then you can try to figure out the real
% height of the display yourself and tell Psychtoolbox about the true value
% before calling Screen('OpenWindow').
%
% Once you know the real height, e.g., VTOTAL, you'd call this function:
% Screen('Preference', 'VBLEndlineOverride', VTOTAL);
%
% How to find out about VTOTAL? One way is to search the display control
% panel on Windows for some area with "Advanced Timing" or "Custom Timing"
% settings. The shareware utility "PowerStrip" (http://www.entechtaiwan.com/util/ps.shtm)
% also allows to change and display these parameters in the Advanced Timing
% -> Vertical Geometry -> "Total" field.
%
% Accuracy of beamposition method:
%
% Cross-checking of beamposition timestamps and kernel-level timestamps on
% a single display PowerPC G5 1.6 Ghz under OS-X 10.4.8 with NVidia
% GeforceFX-5200 showed an accuracy of beamposition timestamping of better
% than 100 microseconds, with a maximum deviation between the different
% methods of less than 200 microseconds.
%
% Initial checking on two Window PC's (Dell Inspiron 8000 Laptop, Geforce
% 2Go, Windows 2000, and some 3.2 Ghz Pentium-4 with NVidia Geforce 7800
% GTX) shows a precision of about 30 microseconds. No further testing on
% Windows has been performed yet by us, but multiple users performed
% similar testing procedures on their setups and confirmed the high
% accuracy and reliability for various MacOSX and Windows setups.
%
% The results of systematic studies can be found in the PsychDocumentation/
% subfolder, the ECVP Timingprecision poster as a pdf file. They confirm
% the robustness and high precision of beamposition timestamping and Linux
% built in timestamping on a variety of tested hardware + operating system
% combinations in various system configurations.
